# Lensless Digital In-Line Holography
This repository contains all of the code & references used for my BTP in the academic year 2021-22
<br><br>
The folder `MATLAB_US_TIE` contains the code for phase retrieval using TIE and the folder `MATLAB_MultiPhase` contains the MATLAB code for PRDS. All of the references can be found in the `Papers` folder.
<br> <br>
The report `Lensless_Microscopy_Using_RaspberryPi` is also kept in this repository.
<br><br>
For more reference, my predecessor's work can be observed in this fork: [Lens-free microscopy](https://github.com/jaybee-117/Lens-free-microscopy)
